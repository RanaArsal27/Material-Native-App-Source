Our glass/metal adhesive systems are designed to speed processing, improve productivity, enhance quality and lower costs. They are widely employed in the optical, fiber-optic, laser, microelectronic, automotive and appliance industries. They can be manually, semi-automatically or automatically applied. Custom packaging options for small to large quantities consists of syringes, cartridges, gun applicators and flexible divider pouches. Premixed and frozen syringes ranging from 1cc to 5cc to 10cc provide easy dispensing for two component epoxy systems. Products are ROHS compliant.

Deepmaterial adhesive delivers superior physical strength properties, low shrinkage upon curing and good non-yellowing stability. This system bonds well to a wide variety of similar and dissimilar substrates including glass and metals. Other notable features include outstanding durability, good electrical insulation properties, and thermal cycling capabilities.

Offering high temperature resistance up to 400°F, Deepmaterial adhesive is a one component adhesive/sealant that withstands thermal cycling and many harsh chemicals. After curing, Deepmaterial adhesive readily obtains a tensile shear strength in excess of 2,100 psi. It can be applied to vertical surfaces without sagging or dripping and is frequently used for glass to metal bonding.

Featuring high light transmission properties, Deepmaterial adhesive resists temperatures up to 400°F. It conforms to Title 21, FDA Chapter 1, Section 175.105 for indirect food applications. It exhibits impressive physical strength and excellent adhesion to both similar and dissimilar substrates. With a very low shrinkage after cure, it forms bonds that are rigid and resistant to chemicals. Deepmaterial adhesive has a four to one mix ratio by weight and is available in convenient syringe and gun applicators.
